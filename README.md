This script composite_em_properties_ghz_thz.py generates:

ε′(f) and ε″(f) vs frequency
 reflectivity R(f)
comparison of E-glass, S-glass, PAN-based CF, Pitch-based CF
frequency range 30 GHz → 3 THz
Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory
includes carbon fiber conductivity and THz dispersion
accounts for anisotropy through ⟂ and ∥ permittivity models (included below)
